Welcome to my personal learning journal where I share snippets of code, works-in-progress, thoughts, experiments, analyses, wrangling, visualizing, modelling and anything else I do with data.  

I've found this site useful to store things I learn and mistakes I've made.    

I'm Australian born, New Guinea raised, living in Adelaide.      

I have worked in factories, farms, juice stations, theatres, bars and offices.     

Some things I like include heavy metal on 10, chilli, cybermen, tabletop roleplaying games and whisky.
