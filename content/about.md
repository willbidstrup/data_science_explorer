>““Exploration is curiosity put into action.”  
> ― **Don Walsh**  

I'm an Australian born, New Guinea raised man interested in living a good life. I've worked in factories, farms, juice stations, theatres, bars and offices. I look after capacity and workforce planning for [Publicis.Sapient](https://publicis.sapient.com/content/psredesign/en-us.html).  I've self-published music and a book. I like heavy metal, chilli, cybermen, tabletop roleplaying games and learning.     
    
Welcome to my online notebook where I share snippets of code, works-in-progress, thoughts and small experiments in data analysis, wrangling, visualizing, modelling and anything else I play around with that falls broadly into the category of scientific exploration or doing things with data.
