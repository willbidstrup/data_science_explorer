This is a test of publishing a Jupyter notebook to my blogdown website. 

Here are the steps I followed;  

- Cloned my website repo to remote laptop  
- Installed latest version of GitHub Desktop  
- Installed Anaconda  

I followed [this guide](https://www.timlrx.com/2018/03/25/uploading-jupyter-notebook-files-to-blogdown/).


# Here is my Jupyter Notebook code converted to markdown


```python
# Here is some Python code

x = 1
y = 2
z = x + y
print(z)
```

Looks like it worked!
