Today I'm going to have a look at kicking statistics in one of the greatest games on Earth, which is of course Australian Rules Football.

```{r, include = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
install.packages("ggthemes", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
```


```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # For everything
library(ggthemes) # For some prettier themes
```

# Data

Big thanks to [DFSAustralia](https://twitter.com/DFSAustralia) for the script that helped me pull this from [AFL Tables](https://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html).

```{r, message = FALSE}
d <- read_csv("data/afl_stats_2018.csv")
glimpse(d)
```

For now, I am interested in Kicks, which I am going to guess is represented as "K".

# Exploratory Visuals

I'm going to run some plots to get a feel for the data. Because I feel like stirring the pot, in some I will compare Power and Crows to the rest of the competition by giving each a unique colour.  

I'm selecting my custom colours from [this site](https://www.colorhexa.com/color-names).

```{r}
d$cust_col <- ifelse(d$TM == "PORT", "PORT",
                     ifelse(d$TM == "ADEL", "ADEL", "OTHERS"))
```


## Kicks per player
```{r}
ggplot(data = d, aes(x = K)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  theme_tufte() +
  labs(title = "Kicks per player", x = "Kicks" , y = "Frequency",
       subtitle = "10 a game is probably fair, 20+ is champion",
       caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: 2018 Round 1-3, afltables.com"))))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = d, aes(x = K)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  facet_grid(. ~ RD) +
  theme_tufte() +
  labs(title = "Kicks per player, by round", x = "Team" , y = "Kicks ",
       subtitle = "Maybe more kicks overall in round 2 and 3?",
       caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: 2018 Round 1-3, afltables.com"))))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = d, aes(x = factor(YR), y = K)) +
geom_boxplot() +
  theme_tufte() +
  labs(title = "Kicks per player - distribution", x = "Year" , y = "Kicks ",
       subtitle = "Median is 10 (50% above and below)",
       caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: 2018 Round 1-3, afltables.com"))))

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = d, aes(x = factor(YR), y = K, col = cust_col)) +
geom_boxplot() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#4682b4","#8b8589", "#008080")) +
  theme_tufte() +
  labs(title = "Kicks per player - distribution", x = "Year" , y = "Kicks ",
       subtitle = "Port and Crows higher median than the rest",
       caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: 2018 Round 1-3, afltables.com"))))

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = d, aes(x = factor(RD), y = K)) +
geom_boxplot() +
    facet_grid(. ~ RD) +
  theme_tufte() +
  labs(title = "Kicks per player - distribution", x = "Round" , y = "Kicks ",
       subtitle = "Round 3 overall higher proportion of more kicks, round 2 most champions",
       caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: 2018 Round 1-3, afltables.com"))))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = d, aes(x = factor(RD), y = K, col = cust_col)) +
geom_boxplot() +
    facet_grid(. ~ cust_col) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#4682b4","#8b8589", "#008080")) +
  theme_tufte() +
  labs(title = "Kicks per player - distribution", x = "Round" , y = "Kicks ",
       subtitle = "Crows might be trending up, Port trending down (median)",
       caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: 2018 Round 1-3, afltables.com"))))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = d, aes(x = TM, y = K, col = cust_col)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#4682b4","#8b8589", "#008080")) +
  theme_tufte() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))  +
  labs(title = "Which team's are kicking the most?", x = "Team" , y = "Kicks",
       subtitle = "Gold Coast Suns (GCFC) also a high kicking team",
       caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: 2018 Round 1-3, afltables.com"))))
```

# Kicks and scoring

I realise many kicks are not shots at goal, but I wanted to see the relationship between kicking and scoring in general.  

```{r}
total_kicks <- d %>%
  group_by(TM, cust_col, RD, Score ) %>%
  summarise(Total_Kicks = sum(K, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(data = total_kicks, aes(x = Total_Kicks, y = Score, group = TM, col = cust_col)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#4682b4", "#8b8589", "#008080")) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_tufte() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))  +
  labs(title = "Number of Kicks and Score", x = "Total Kicks" , y = "Score",
       subtitle = "Adelaide teams seem to use kicking effectively",
       caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: 2018 Round 1-3, afltables.com"))))
```
