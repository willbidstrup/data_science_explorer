  Today I take a closer look at the info available in the [fitzRoy package](https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy).

  This is such a great example of what is happening in the R community these days, the package really takes away the difficulty out of scraping the web for data.  

I will limit myself to **one hour**. This will cover all the poking and prodding of the data and the writing and editing of this post.

My goal is to look a bit more deeply at the data in the package to spur my imagination for future more in-depth reports.

My time starts now...


# Packages

Here is my setup (install before calling library).  

```{r, include = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
install.packages("here", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
install.packages("ggthemes", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
install.packages("devtools", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
devtools::install_github("jimmyday12/fitzRoy")
install.packages("GGally", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")

```

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Packages
library(tidyverse) # For everything
library(here) # For project-oriented workflow
library(ggthemes) # For nice plot themes
library(devtools) # For non-CRAN packages
library(fitzRoy) # Data source
library(GGally) # Correlation plot
```


# Explore

I'm following along from the [documentation](https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy/blob/master/README.md).  


## Match Results

I've used this before, it's the first suggested data set. The stats are basic but it's every game since 1897!

```{r}
d <- get_match_results()
```

Use glimpse to get a feel for the data;

```{r}
glimpse(d)
```


Example visual;

```{r}

ggplot(data = d, aes(x = Date, y = Margin)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Margin trend in AFL",
        x = "Date",
        y = "Margin (pts)",
        caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: AFL games 1897 to 2018 c/o fitzRoy package"))))


```


## Tidy Match Results

There is a helpful functionto that shapes the results data into a longer format.  I could have used this previously when calculating the [Home/Away difference in goal kicking accuracy](https://www.datascienceexplorer.com/post/animated-afl/).  

```{r}
d_long <- convert_results(d)
```

```{r}
glimpse(d_long)
```

Example visual;

```{r}


ggplot(data = d_long, aes(x = Date, y = Margin, col = Round.Type)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(. ~ Round.Type) +
  labs(title = "Margin trend in AFL",
       subtitle = "Tighter in finals (slightly)",
        x = "Date",
        y = "Margin (pts)",
        caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: AFL games 1897 to 2018 c/o fitzRoy package"))))

```



## Fixture

There is a function to 'get fixture'. I admit I don't know what this means, but on inspection it looks like it is a list of all the games that will be played in current year (excluding finals). 
```{r}
d_fixture <- get_fixture()
```

```{r}
glimpse(d_fixture)
```


Example visual;

```{r}
# table showing number of games by venue
venue_games <- d_fixture %>%
  group_by(Venue,) %>%
  summarise(games = n())

# plot
ggplot(d = venue_games, aes(x = reorder(Venue, games), y = games)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
    labs(title = "Where AFL will be played in 2018",
       subtitle = "",
        x = "Venue",
        y = "Number of games",
        caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: AFL 2018 fixture c/o fitzRoy package"))))
```


## Footywire

Footywire stats are more detailed, and go back to 2010.  Lots of stats here, I don't understand all of them! Will start with a correlation plot to see what might be related.  

```{r}
d_fwire <- update_footywire_stats()
```

```{r}
glimpse(d_fwire)
```

Example visual;

```{r}
ggcorr(d_fwire, method = c("pairwise", "pearson"), nbreaks = 9, hjust = .75, vjust = 0.5, layout.exp = 2) +
  labs(title = "Correlation of Footywire dataset numeric variables")

```



## Weather

This is awesome. There is weather data for 2017!  

```{r}
d_weather<- fitzRoy::results_weather %>%
  filter(Season == 2017)
```

```{r}
glimpse(d_weather)
```


Example visual;

```{r}
ggplot(data = d_weather, aes(x = Margin, y = Rainfall, col = Rainfall)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth() +
     labs(title = "Does higher rainfall lead to tigher games?",
       subtitle = "Maybe??",
        x = "Margin",
        y = "Rainfall",
        caption = expression(paste(italic("Source: AFL 2017 + weather c/o fitzRoy package"))))
```


## Tips

Finally, there is tipping info here. I'm really looking forward to exploring the different methods used to arrive at these.  

```{r}
d_tips <- get_squiggle_data("tips")
```
*Didn't get time to explore here - next time!*


# Conclusion

I realise I've just pretty much gone through the documentation, but since I learn from doing, this is a good thing. I have a much better understanding of the info available in this package and am excited about having a closer look soon.
