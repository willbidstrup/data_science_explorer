      <description>Today I take a closer look at the info available in the fitzRoy package.
 This is such a great example of what is happening in the R community these days, the package really takes away the difficulty out of scraping the web for data.
I will limit myself to one hour. This will cover all the poking and prodding of the data and the writing and editing of this post.</description>

      <description>Today I explore the gganimate package with AFL data from the fitzRoy package.
Here are the packages used.

      <description>Update: There is far less of a relationship between goal accuracy and margin than originally published - I’ve fixed the error in code below which was using Away.Points instead of Away.Behinds in calculating goal-kicking accuracy.
Today I practice ggplot2 and investigate skills in the AFL.
The #AFLWonkWednesdays week 2 topic is;
What is going on with skills?
There has been a lot of chatter about the quality of skills and goal kicking in the AFL of late.</description>

      <description>Today I’m going to have a look at kicking statistics in one of the greatest games on Earth, which is of course Australian Rules Football.
