      <description>Today I practice some time-series forecasting techniques in R by applying them to total scores in the AFL.
The question I am interested in answering is - “what kind of average scores should we expect in AFL over next 10 years”
Here are the packages used;
# Packages library(tidyverse) # For everything ## Warning: package &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.5.1 library(here) # For project-oriented workflow library(ggthemes) # For nice plot themes library(forecast) # For nice plot themes library(devtools) # For non-CRAN packages library(fitzRoy) # Data source Set up and EDA I create a data set for simple time-series analysis.</description>

      <description>Today I explore time series forecasting use AFL data from the fitzRoy package.
Key concepts A forecast is the mean of simulated futures.
 Making a ts object
 Trend, Seasonality, Cyclicity
 Plotting lags and ACF
 White noise
 Creating forecast objects
 Checking residuals Mean Absolute Scaled Error Cross Validation Exponential Smoothing   Things to do # TODO - figure out why full ts doesn&amp;#39;t show info from the 1900s # Packages library(tidyverse) # For everything ## Warning: package &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.</description>
